This is a quick repository I set up for Lost Ones. 

To contribute:
- DM me and I'll make the edits for you.
- Edit on [this Github page](https://github.com/Vihaan3/Lost-Ones-Wiki/tree/v4/content) directly
	- To make an edit to an existing page in the wiki, find that page in `content` folder and then use the pencil icon. 
	- To create a new page in the wiki, create a new page in the `content` folder. 
- For heavier editing in a more streamlined environment:
	1. Clone this repository locally
	2. Download Obsidian
	3. Open the folder as a vault in Obsidian
	4. Make your edits!
